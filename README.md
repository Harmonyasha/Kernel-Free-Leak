# Kernell-Free-Leak
Vrchat client
# Info
[Free](https://kernell.net/free-downloads) version of kernell client
# Why i leak
I leak that client bc 'data' love me so much <3 I find it amusing when skid bans me for revealing the Vitality namespace (other client) in his client and calling him a skid for that.


They have IP logger inside client even can put malware inside, you can check proofs below.


KernellNoWebSocket.dll (should be in Mods folder in MelonLoader, remove their .dll loader from Plugins) has offline mode, no activity about you gonna be sent to kernell servers.
