# Why i leak
I leak that client bc 'data' love me so much <3 I find it amusing when skid bans me for revealing the Vitality namespace (other client) in his client and calling him a skid for that.


They utilize an IP logger and a World Join Logger, and can forcibly close your game in the future they may add malware to the client. You can review the evidence below.


KernellNoWebSocket.dll (should be in Mods folder in MelonLoader, remove their .dll loader from Plugins) has offline mode, no activity about you gonna be sent to kernell servers.
